I love Anki and would like to see it improved. I throw a ton of notes into anki to study in my down time.

I decided to create a running log of the problems I have using Anki and what I would like to see improved.

I decided to use Github issues because they support comments and I can edit the issues with markdown so I can be expressive with video, images, etc.
